# Reversi-Game
My first project ever programming in C. 

This project is a fantastic example of how not to program in C, and some components are a great example of how bad programming leads to unmaintainable code. Why this ever worked is absolutely beyond me. Some key points that can be learned from this repo are: 
1. Don't get to fancy with your functions and try reinvent the wheel, some things are done the way they are for a reason. 
2. Write generic code, a number of functions in this simple project are unnecessary as if the code was written better the need for separation of said functions would not exist. 
3. Actually write code that meets the standard, this code compiles with a ton of warnings, generally that is a bad sign, fix the warnings as they come as opposed to having a project like this.

Having said all that, it does compile and run as intended so have fun playing!
